  Hybrid Millidecade Band Sound Pressure Levels Computed at 1 Minute Resolution
  from Oceanic Passive Acoustic Monitoring Recordings at site USTR01 in the Gulf
  of Maine, USA
summary: >-
  To understand natural and anthropogenic sound in the ocean, and to compare
  underwater soundscapes globally, standard methods of analysis must be applied
  to passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) data. Methods that balance constrained
  volume and adequate resolution of acoustic spectra have recently been
  published (Martin et al., 2021a,b). A community effort supported by NOAA, BOEM,
  U.S. Navy, and ONR was initiated to apply these methods to PAM datasets from
  around the world. This record represents the hybrid millidecade band (HMB)
  spectra of sound levels derived from calibrated PAM data.

  Original hybrid millidecade spectra were produced by the NOAA Northeast

  Data analysis was performed using Python Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PyPAM)
  software, version {{PyPAM_version}}, to produce hybrid millidecade band (HMB)
  spectra of sound levels from oceanic audio recordings. Processing followed the
  methods defined in Martin et al. (2021a,b). Input wav data were computed to µPa,
  and power spectral density (PSD) levels were computed from 1-minute segments of
  audio data using Welch's method. By applying fast Fourier transform (FFT) with
  length equal to the sample rate, using Hann window and 50% overlap, PSD
  estimates (µPa^2/Hz) were computed with a frequency resolution of 1 Hz and a
  temporal resolution of 1 second. The 119 PSD estimates from each 1-minute
  segment were averaged, and the average spectrum for each minute was further
  processed to an HMB spectrum following Martin et al. (2021b).
