# Development

Routine command recipes are captured in a [`justfile`](justfile),
to be run with the handy [`just`](https://github.com/casey/j) tool,
which I alias to `j` in my shell.

Run:
```shell
j
```
to see the available recipes (and look at [`justfile`](justfile) for more details).

### Setup

Upon a fresh clone:
```shell
j setup
```

Upon updating dependencies:
```shell
j update-deps
```

While working on the code, you want to keep all unit testing green:
```shell
j test
```

**NOTE**: Before committing/pushing any changes, make sure to run:
```shell
j all
```
which includes type checking, testing, and formatting and linting with ruff:
```text
poetry run mypy .
Success: no issues found in 35 source files
