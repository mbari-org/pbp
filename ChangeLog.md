2024-04

- Adjusted logging to be less verbose

2024-03

- For global attributes, now resolving the `{{PyPAM_version}}` snippet against the
  actual version number (according to `importlib.metadata`).
  Also added a `{{PBP_version}}` snippet in case we eventually want to use it.
- removed `--gen-csv` option (not really used/needed)
- added `--version` option to the programs
- minor code reorg
- enabled poetry
    - now packaging and publishing to PyPI 
    - TODO ongoing: README/justfile adjustments, etc. 
- added this ChangeLog.
