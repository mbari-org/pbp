# PyPAM based data processing

This package uses [PyPAM](https://github.com/lifewatch/pypam/)
to generate _hybrid millidecade band spectra_ for soundscape data.

**Status**: Functional version, including support for cloud based processing.

- [x] JSON generation of timekeeping
- [x] Timekeeping based on given JSON indicating start and duration of every available (recognized) sound file
- [x] Audio file processing
    - [x] Frequency and psd array output
    - [x] Concatenation of processed 1-minute segments for daily product
    - [x] Calibration with given sensitivity file (NetCDF)
    - [x] Calibration with given flat sensitivity value
- [x] Data products
    - [x] NetCDF with metadata
    - [x] CSV (optional)
    - [x] Summary plot (optional)
- [x] Cloud processing
    - [x] Inputs can be downloaded from S3
    - [x] Outputs can be uploaded to S3
    - [x] Inputs can be downloaded from public GCS bucket
    - [ ] Outputs can be uploaded to GCS
